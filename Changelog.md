[v1.4.0.x](https://bitbucket.org/zxbasic/zxbasic/commits/tag/v1.4.0.x)
===

This is a long (near 3 year) set of versions in which the compiler
was refactored in many places. The compiler migrated from one-pass
no objects compiler to a multiple pass object like compiler.
This not only makes the code much more maintainable and elegant, but
also a bit faster.

Technical stuff:
Now the AST uses an heterogeneous AST pattern, allowing both children
traversal using indexes (and also primitives like `node.appendChild`)
and attribute traversal which depends on the `symbolTYPE` being parsed.
e.g. for `symbolBINARY` (binary expressions), we have `node.left`, `node.right`,
`node.operand`, but also `node.children[0]`, `node.children[1]`.

The major feature in this release is the posibility to declare nested functions.
These functions are declared within others, and can only be called from within
their respective parent function body.

v1.2.5
===

  Fixed. Now it even tries to optimize ASM users code.
+ ! The @operator was broken under some circumstances (array accesses and variables). Fixed.
+ ! The memory heap was also broken almost always when using any string in the program (INKEY$, STR$, CHR$, $ variables). Fixed.
+ ! Signed LONG division was wrong for positive divisors. Fixed.
+ ! Byte comparison operators < > = >= <= were sometimes bugged. Fixed.
+ ! using MOD with Fixed type was unsupported. Fixed. Now MOD used Fixed type.

v1.2.4
===
* Added `SAVE`/`LOAD`/`VERIFY` `CODE`/`SCREEN$` capabilities (uses ROM routines)
* Fixed a bug in `@ `operand which produced a memory leak

v1.2.3
===
* ! `CHR$` and `STR$` might not use the HEAP without initializing
  it first, leading to memory corruption. Fixed. Thanks to Britlion.
* HEAP size can now be set with a command line parameter.

v1.2.2
===
* ! `DIM` with array base was buggy. Fixed.
* ! `INK 8` and `PAPER 8` were being ignored. Now they work.

v1.2.0
===
* ! `DIM f% = <value>` was not working. Now it does.
* ! HEAP memory init routine slightly improved.
  Also removed a possible bug of memory corruption reported
  by Britlion. (Thanks)
* New memory scheme: Now variables and heap zone are moved
  to the end of the memory (high area). This should make
  easier to implement data bank switching on 128K machines.
  It also allows to `SAVE` all data memory in a single block.
  This is a feature to be implemented in near-future releases.
* ! Undeclared local variables caused a compiler error.
  They should just compile (like global ones do).
* ! String variables used in string slices where sometimes
  optimized (ignored).
* ! `ELSEIF` constructions were not being compiled correctly.

v1.1.9
===
+ ! Fixed a bug for constant string slicing, so
  `"0909"(A TO B)` now works. Thanks to Britlion.
+ ! Expanded grammar to allow something like `"0909"(f)`
  or `"0909"()` which are also allowed in **Sinclair Basic**. Thanks to Britlion.
+ ! Using expressions like `"0909"(f)` (like above) might corrupt the
  HEAP memory, leading to a program crash. Fixed. Thanks, Britlion :-)
+ ! Fixed a bug in typecast from signed integers to float which
  sometimes overflowed leading to wrong results.

v1.1.8
===
+ ! `%` suffix was being ignored. Fixed.
+ ! Global string variables were not optimized unless declared
  with `$` suffix. Fixed.

v1.1.7
===
+ ! `BOLD` and `ITALIC` could not be used as permanent attributes,
  only as temporary ones. Now they are allowed as permanent too.
+ Some more syntax compatibility with **Sinclair BASIC**. Expressions
  like `F$(5)` and `PRINT ;;;` are now allowed.
+ ! Single `PRINT` sentences were not working (they should print a
  newline).
+ Minor grammar corrections.
+ ! Using a suffix like `$` in a function declaration was being
  ignored. Now it's taken into account.
+ Added support for `PRINT ,` (thanks to Britlion and LCD for the
  suggestions and bug detection)

v1.1.6
===
+ ! Fixed many optimization bugs (almost five). Thanks to LCD
+ ! Fixed ChangeLog file
+  Internal refactored code (somewhat)

v1.1.5
===
+ Added the `ELSEIF` construct to the `IF THEN ELSE` sentence
+ Added more optimizations in some jumps

+ Optimized some print string generated code (now it's smaller)

v1.1.4
===
+ The peephole optimizer has been enabled and seems to be working
  reasonably well.
+ ! When a DIV BY ZERO error occurs with floating point numbers the program
  crashes and resets the computer. This behaviour has been fixed
  and now returns 0 value and sets the error code 6 (Number Too big)
  in the `ERR_NR` system variable.
+ Refactorization of both the assembler and compiler so they now
  shared the OPTIONS storage in a better way (still to be finished). This
  makes easier to program future compiler options. Now also `--debug`
  flag is additive, showing more verbosity the more it is used.
+ Memory optimization: `PRINT` routine (which is about 1K size) is not
  included if not USED.

v1.1.2
===
+ ! Fixed a bug in negative constant integer typecasting (Thanks to LCD
  at WoS for reporting it! `;-)`). It was causing decremental `FOR`..`NEXT`
  to fail.
+ ! Scientific notation numbers (e.g. `2e10`) were not correctly parsed.
  Fixed. Thanks again to LCD. ;-)
+ Added `TAB` compatibility for the `PRINT` command (both as a command
  and as a `CHR$` control character).
+ `PRINT` code optimized for size, maintaining speed.

v1.1.1
===
+ ! Fixed a bug in `CONTINUE DO` which was not being correctly compiled
+ `PRINT` routines were included even when neither PRINT nor
  drawing primitives were used. Optimized.
+ ! Fixed a lot of syntax error checks with array operations.
+ ! Fixed array dimension checking
+ Expanded syntax: Direct array assignation `a = b` (being a and b
  arrays of the same type an size)
+ ! Fixes an error exception on syntax error for array subscripting.
+ Changed alloc functions to match names of that of FreeBASIC ones.
+ Using a wrong sigil in array declaration is now forbidden.
+  Better sigils (suffixes) types managements at `DIM` declarations.
+ Lot of internal source code refactoring
+ `DIM r AT @a(k0, k1, ...)` is allowed (being k0, k1, ... constants)
+! Fixed a bug for local variables and parameters when the offset is
  very large (> 128)
+ Enabled the `--sinclair` cmdline flag for automatic sinclair libraries inclusion
+ Added `SetAttr()` routine which changes the attribute of
  screen coordinate at (I, J) with the given color attr value.
+ ! Fixed buggy `modu16` and `modi16` IC implementation that was not compiling
  correctly
+ Output asm code is now slightly optimized (for speed an memory)
+ ! Fixed a bug in integer parameters (16 and 32 bits)
+ ! Fixed a compiler crash when using arrays of Fixed Point numbers

v1.1.0
===
* SCREEN$ coordinated were swapped. Fixed.

+ Added ITALIC "attribute". PRINT ITALIC 1; "Hello"
+ Added malloc, free and realloc functions to work with the heap
* Some code rearrangement
* The IFDEF directive was not working in the preprocessor. Fixed.

+ Added better error handling for parameter declaration
+ Added `UCase` function
+ Added `Lcase` and fixed ucase to be case insensitive
+ Added `MultiKeys` function (similar to that of FreeBASIC) so
  multiple keys can be checked at once
+ Added `GetKeyScanCodes`
+ Added HEX and HEX16 functions to return HEXadecimal
  string representation of numbers
+ Fixed a bug when `a$(n TO)` was specified
+ ! Optimization: Remove unnecessary jumps at function returns.
+ ! `store16` IC instruction now generates a more efficient backend (Z80 ASM) code.
+ Added alias for arrays. Now you can declare:
  ```
  DIM a(10)
  DIM c at @a
  ```
+ ! Better code generation for `store32` and `storef` backend
+ ! Optimized constant array assignation as a direct store.
+ ! Added constant array Read access optimizations
