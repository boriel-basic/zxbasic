INSTALL
-------

Go to the ZXBasic download page [http://www.boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZX_BASIC:Archive]
and get the version most suitable for you. 

These tools are completely written in python, so you will need a python
interpreter (available on many platforms). Just copy them in a directory of your
choice and installation is done. :-)

For Windows users there is also a binary .MSI installation, which does not need
python installed.
