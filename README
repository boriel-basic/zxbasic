INSTALL
-------

Go to the ZXBasic download page [http://www.boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZX_BASIC:Archive]
and get the version most suitable for you. 

These tools are completely written in python, so you will need a python
interpreter (available on many platforms). Just copy them in a directory of your
choice and installation is done. :-)

For Windows users there is also a binary .MSI installation, which does not need
python installed.


TESTING
-------

You will need to get Tox in order to run the project tests. Normally it is done
by calling:

~~~~
$ pip install tox
~~~~

inside a Virtual Environment ( https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/ ).

Please, see https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html for more
information about installing Tox.

Once you have installed Tox, just call:

~~~~
$ tox
~~~~

to get your tests running.
