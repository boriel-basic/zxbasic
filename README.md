DOCUMENTATION
-------------

This is a very little help file.

For DOCUMENTATION in English go to the ZX BASIC Wiki:
<http://www.zxbasic.net>

For help, support, updates meet the community at my forum:

INSTALLATION
------------

Go to the ZXBasic download page <http://www.boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZX_BASIC:Archive>
and get the version most suitable for you.

There are, basically, two flavors (both with identical capabilities):

 - For Windows you can download de win32 executable (Windows .exe zip package) version. 
To install just uncompress it in a directory of your choice.
The main executable is `zxb.exe` (more on this later). With this toolchain
also comes `zxbasm.exe` (the assembler) and `zxbpp.exe` (the preprocessor), but these 
are not needed when programming in BASIC.

 - For Linux and Mac OSX there is a python version, so you will need a python
interpreter (available on many platforms, and usually already installed in Linux and Mac OSX).
Just uncompress it in a directory of your choice and installation is done. :-)
The main executables are `zxb.py` (the compiler), `zxbasm.py` (the assembler) and `zxbpp.py` (the preprocessor).
You can use this version in Windows, but will need to install a python interpreter first.

QUICK START
-----------

For a quick start, just open a terminal in your PC in the same directory you uncompressed ZX Basic
and type `zxb` (on Windows) or `zxb.py` (OSX, Linux). You should see a zxbasic message like this:

```
usage: zxb [-h] [-d] [-O OPTIMIZE] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-T] [-t] [-B] [-a] [-A]
           [-S ORG] [-e STDERR] [--array-base ARRAY_BASE]
           [--string-base STRING_BASE] [-Z] [-H HEAP_SIZE] [--debug-memory]
           [--debug-array] [--strict-bool] [--enable-break] [-E] [--explicit]
           [-D DEFINES] [-M MEMORY_MAP] [-i] [-I INCLUDE_PATH] [--strict]
           [--version]
           PROGRAM
zxb: error: the following arguments are required: PROGRAM
```

Create a text file with the following content:

~~~~
10 CLS
20 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"
~~~~

Save it as `hello.bas` and finally compile it with:
~~~~
zxb -taB hello.bas
~~~~

If everything went well, a file named `hello.tap` should be created.
Open it with your favourite emulator (i.e. fuse) and see the result.

Congratulations! You're now ready to create compiled BASIC programs for
your machine. Check and compile the examples included in the examples/ folder
or go to the Wiki <http://zxbasic.net> for further info.
