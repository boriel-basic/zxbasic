INSTALL
-------

Go to the ZXBasic download page <http://www.boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZX_BASIC:Archive>
and get the version most suitable for you. 

This tools are completely written in python, so you will need a python
interpreter (available on many platforms).

Just copy them in a directory of your choice and installation is done. :-)
For Windows users there is also a binary .MSI installation, which does not need
python installed.
