#External resources

* Here you are [[ZX BASIC:External_Resources|external resources]]: other tools, IDEs, graphic designers and projects related to ZX BASIC. Have a look!

#Language Reference
* [[ZX BASIC:Syntax|Language syntax]]
<br />Language Syntax is very close to the original Sinclair BASIC, but it's expanded and enhanced.

* [[ZX BASIC:Types|Data types]]
<br />Language data types: Instead of working always with Floating Point numbers (also available), there are also some integer types which are faster an take less memory.

 * [Reserved words](identifier.md)
<br />Comprehensive list (alphabetically ordered) of identifiers you shouldn't use as a ''variable name''. E.g. `FOR`, `PRINT`. If you want usage instructions on a statement, also look here.

# External libraries

* [[ZX BASIC:Library|Library]]
<br />Library of functions and subroutines you can use in your programs. You might find them really useful.

# Inline assembler
Embedding inline assembler in your code is pretty easy. There's a [[ZX_BASIC:Tutorials tutorial]] on it.

# Compiler internals
Only for true hackers: This explains how the compiler does it job, how to expand it, etc. You must be a bit crazy if you enter here...

# Other Architectures
ZX Basic was designed from the base as a Retargeable Compiler, so it should be not hard to extend it to other architectures. This is `work in progress`. See [[ZX_BASIC:Other architectures|Other Architectures]] for more info.
